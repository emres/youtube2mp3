# youtube2mp3: A very simple system to download YouTube music videos and convert them to mp3 files

This is a very simple and short Bash script to provide a GUI for downloading
YouTube music videos and convert them to MP3 files. I developed this for my
personal use (and to help a few friends) and then thought it would be helpful to
others, too. So here it is.

The script currently depends on zenity, youtube-dl and ffmpeg. I have
tested it on Ubuntu GNU/Linux machines.

## How to Install

- Install packages (debian/ubuntu): aptitude install ffmpeg youtube-dl zenity lame
- Install packages (archlinux):     pacman -S ffmpeg youtube-dl zenity lame
- Run install.sh

Alternatively you can simply make youtube2mp3.sh executable and then run:

    ./youtube2mp3.sh

on the command line (or create a shortcut to it for easier access).

## Help

Usage: youtube2mp3.sh [args]
    Runs in interactive mode if no args are given
        (dialog boxes will prompt for input)
    Runs in non-interactive mode if any args are given

    args = --url="<url>" |
           --odir=<odir> |
           --rate=<rate> |
           --ffmpeg |
           --vkeep |
           --help

    args may be given in any order
      url must be given (enclose <url> in quotes)
      odir defaults to current directory
      rate defaults to 256
      --vkeep: keeps downloaded video file (default is to delete)
      --avconv: use avconv converter, not ffmpeg
      --help: emits this message
